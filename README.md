# Vigorous
Vigorous is a personal development platform designed to help users structure their routines, economy, studies, training, and goals – all in one place. Built as a long-term project to apply and demonstrate my skills in system development, Java, databases, and UX design.

The purpose of Vigorous is to:
* apply and deepen the skills I learn during my System Science studies at Luleå University of Technology
* build a long-term portfolio project
* learn-by-doing through real system development
* create a tool for people like me - ambitious individuals who need structure, clarity and routines to reach their full potential

Roadmap:
Phase 1: Foundation
* Create GitHub repository (very basic, this is the first time I've ever used GitHub)
* Write project vision
* Create inital documentation
* UX sketches (basic layout)
* Initial database design

Phase 2: Java Prototype
Phase 3:
etc...

About me:
My name is Vigor, therefor Vigorous is named after me. The english word "vigorous" means energetic and powerful. This project is personal in a sense that I want to build something that helps people like me to unlock their potential.
