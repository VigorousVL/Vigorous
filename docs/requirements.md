# Vigorous - Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
Vigorous is my long-term project I came up with during my study-time at Luleå University of Technology. I am a motivated person who wants to achieve high results at the same pace as I live a healthy lifestyle regarding training, planning my economy and do things I enjoy. To achieve all these I need structure, routines and a detailed plan. Therefor I want to create a system, that gathers everything for personal development in one place.

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of Vigorous is to provide a unified platform for individuals who want to structure their entire life in one place, such as routines, economy, studies, training, goals and long-term projects.

#### 1.1.2 Self-purpose
Vigorous is also developed as a long-term portfolio project to:
- apply the knowledge gained during my system science studies at LTU
- improve through learn-by-doing
- demonstrate full-stack development skills to future employers
- build a personal tool that reflects my own values, goals, and ambitions

### 1.2 Target Users
Primary target users:
- Highly motivated individuals who already know they want structure and clarity in their daily life
- Students, athletes, professionals and personal development enthusiasts
- Users who want one unified system instead of many separate apps

Secondary target users:
